This is the Motorola Common section.

HijackedBootmenu is included here for ICS under the hijack/ folder.

Extras that need to be done:

******************************************************
*** Update the project to pull from Wizard0f0s git ***
******************************************************

At the base of your build, change to the .repo directory (cd .repo).
Edit the manifest.xml file.  File the line that points to "CyanogenMod/android_device_moto_hijack" (without quotes).
Replace the "CyanogenMod" portion with "wizard0f0s" (the 0's are zeros, not o's).  Change back to the base of your repo.
Run "repo sync" to pull down the new git source.

***********************************
*** Shadow Modifications **********
***********************************

Shadow needs to be modified to include the proper permission settings.
